# Docker Development Box

This is a basic Ubuntu 14.04 Linux-box for development with Docker. It's by no means complete, but still a work in progress.

## Features

 - Shared Docker TCP ports with host, you just need to start the box and run commands like you were on a local install

 - Shared OS X Home directory, so you can use `$PWD` for sharing volumes with containers

 - Shared common development TCP ports: HTTP, HTTPS, Node.js, Rails, MySQL and MongoDB
